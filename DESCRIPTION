Description: A procedure to create maps, pie charts, and stacked bar plots 
    showing the trajectory of a variable during a time series. 
    You provide a time series of data sets as a stack of raster files or a 
    data frame and call the various functions in 'timeseriesTrajectories' to create 
    your desired graphics. The methods work for binary and continuous variables.
